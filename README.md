The idea for Round Out spawned from a conversation with friends where we were discussing how our busy, conflicting schedules made it hard to do certain activities because we didn't have enough people to participate. I wanted to build something that could satisfy this need, both for groups who were just shy of the right numbers and individuals who wanted to branch out and meet new people. It provides a platform for people to get out and form new relationships while participating in common interests.

This Rails app features the Google Maps API to give users a visual location of their events, as well as the PGSearch gem for robust searching, Carrierwave and Imagemagick for image uploading and transformation, and Gon for variable retention within Javascript. Ajax is used for the commenting system for a better user experience, and some Javascript and CSS animation on the front end.
